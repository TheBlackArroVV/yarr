## This is a simple RSS reader, which I decided to implement to learn Rust

Current available commands:

1. add <link> - will add <link> to list of followed
2. rss - will render a list of written topics
3. remove <link> - will remove <link> from the list of followed

Plans for the future:

1. Different colors
2. Keeping track of what was already read
